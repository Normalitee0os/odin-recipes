    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is one of my favorite gobi (cauliflower) recipes, and available at many Indian restaurants. A spicy Asian dish that's sure to leave your family wanting more! Occasionally, I even love to bake the cauliflower to lower the calories. Keep in mind, baking will take away from the crispiness of fried cauliflower.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>15 cauliflower florets</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornmeal</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>oil for deep frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Mix flour, cornmeal, water, black pepper, and salt together in a bowl to make a thick batter. Toss in cauliflower florets and mix until coated.</li>
        <li>Deep fry cauliflower a few florets at a time until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
        <li>Mix 1/4 cup vegetable stock with cornmeal in a bowl. Add soy sauce, ketchup, chile-garlic sauce, and salt.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a wok or frying pan over high heat. Add onions, chile pepper, garlic, and ginger and stir-fry for a few seconds. Add cornmeal mixture and cook 1 to 2 minutes. Add remaining vegetable stock and cook until very thick, about 10 minutes. Remove sauce from heat.</li>
        <li>Spoon sauce over fried cauliflower and toss slightly. Garnish with green onions and serve.</li>
    </ol>

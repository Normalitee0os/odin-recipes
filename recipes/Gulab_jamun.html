        <li>½ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
        <li>½ cup instant dry milk powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
        <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>1 pinch saffron (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol><li>Combine water, sugar, cardamom, rose water, and saffron in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until consistency is syrupy, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Mix milk powder, flour, and baking soda in a bowl until well-combined. Slowly mix in butter and yogurt until dough comes together. Let gulab dough rest for 5 minutes. Shape into smooth balls the size of pennies.    </li>
    <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Test the temperature of the oil by dropping in a small piece of dough. When it sits at the bottom of the pan for 1 minute before coming to the surface, the oil is ready.</li>
    <li>Fry 4 gulab balls at a time, stirring carefully, until dark golden brown on all sides, about 2 minutes. Drain on a paper-towel lined plate. Repeat with remaining gulab.</li>
    <li>Bring syrup back up to a boil and drop in fried gulab. Remove from heat and let them soak in the syrup, covered, 45 minutes to 1 hour.</li></ol>
